# Douyin Writing
- Open with a spoken hook that earns the next three seconds.
- Write beat-by-beat scenes, on-screen text, and a single CTA when useful.
- Prefer concrete demonstrations over abstract explanation.
# Writer result contract

After writing or clarifying Douyin copy, call `writer_submit_result` exactly once. Use its flat `schemaVersion: 1` contract: `outcome` is `draft_ready` or `needs_clarification`, `operation` is the current operation, and `draft` contains the complete content/script/caption, title, and numeric `baseRevision` when ready. Include `research: { requested, completed, sourceUrls }` and `assetIntents` with `{ id, kind, prompt, placement, aspectRatio }`; stay within the registry's single cover, 9:16 policy and never fabricate image URLs. For clarification submit `draft: null`; for revisions return every scene and beat in the complete script.
